    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    



    TESTING:

        1) Placed a bet using one account and ensured I am unable to bet again while my bet is ongoing and checked the balances and ongoingBet list.
        2) Placed bets from three more accounts with diffrent predictions and betvalues. Noted their balances and checked ongoinbet list.
        3) Called RewardBet function to ensure everyone got the correct balance updates after bet settlement.
        4) Checked ongoingBet list is empty and completeBet list contains the settle bets.
        5) Repeated the process to ensure one can bet again after his bet is settled.
        6) Kept checking read values at every stage and confirmed only new users get 100 free points.
